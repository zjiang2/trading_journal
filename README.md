# Trading Journal

Interactive application to track your stock trades.

TODO:
- Allow manual entry of stock trades
  - Each row should mutable after entry because you can enter in a trade that has not concluded
- Separate table that tracks summary statistics (eg. win/loss, total gain, etc.)
- Add a notes section. I am thinking this could be another column in the spreadsheet but the note can be see hovering over an icon.
- Tags (eg. reasons for trade)
- Figures (eg. P/L over time)
- Backend
- Make it look nicer
